# Timesheet
**Purpose**

A Java project to demostrate my proficiency, as of December 2023.

This project contains the following:

TimesheetRow.java:

*Implements the methods for creating, updating and deleting TimesheetRows
*Stores each week's hours as a long and uses bit manipulation (binary operators &, |, <<, >> ) to set and get the hours of specific days

Timesheet.java:

*Stores multiple TimesheetRows to act as a database
*Contains functions to create, delete, and manipiulate the rows
